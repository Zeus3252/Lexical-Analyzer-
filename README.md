# Lexical-Analyzer-
This C++ program is a Lexical Analyzer. It analyzes specific input files and lists the tokens with their respective lexemes. There are 3 sets of outputs, one for each of the 3 files included. They are named “file1”, “file2” and “file3” and each contain different small programs of different sizes.  First, the Lexical Analyzer outputs the contents of the file, then the size of the file in bytes and lastly the lexemes and tokens for the file.  For example, for every instance an “int” is read, the program will print this lexeme with its token “VAR_TYPE”. The results are formatted in a table.
